## Quick start

```
gem install mc_forecast
```

```ruby
require "mc_forecast"
# all arguments optional
e = McForecast::Simulation.new.run(init_state: nil, steps: 1, trials: 1_000) do |_state, _step, _trial|
  events = {}
  events[:coin] = rand > 0.5 ? 1 : 0

  # block should return a new state and a hash of events
  [nil, events]
end
# e[:coin][:mean][0] ~ 0.5
# e[:coin][:quantiles][0.025][0] ~ 0
# e[:coin][:quantiles][0.975][0] ~ 1
